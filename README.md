## Overview

This [dashboard](https://housinginitiative.shinyapps.io/PHFA_Housing_Dashboard/) is a collaboration between the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency and the Housing Initiative at Penn, designed to visualize housing affordability trends across Pennsylvania. It showcases current housing trends in counties statewide, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 5-year American Community Survey and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy.

## Data Sources and Methods

The dashboard utilizes the American Community Survey's 2022 5-year estimates and the HUDâ€™s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy dataset (2019) for the Affordable Housing Shortage variable. Data was accessed through the US Census Bureau API using the `tidycensus` package, with processing and preparation done via `dplyr`, `tigris`, `sf`, `stringr`, and `tidyr`. Visualizations are created using `leaflet`, `plotly`, `ggplot2`, and `pander` in the R-language with Posit's R-Shiny app interface.

### Indicators

-   **Homeownership rate (%) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The percentage of households that own their homes. A higher rate indicates a greater proportion of homeowners in the area.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Rentership rate (%) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The share of households in a county that rent their homes. Younger households and households with limited incomes are more likely to rent than older households and households with higher incomes.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Vacant rental units (%) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The percentage of rental units that are currently unoccupied. A higher percentage can suggest that there's a surplus of rental housing or potentially decreased demand.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Median age of home (years) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The midpoint age of homes in a specific area. Older median ages can suggest historical or older neighborhoods, while lower values might indicate newer developments.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Median home value (\$) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The midpoint value of homes in the area. This can provide an insight into the overall affordability and property values of a region.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Households with internet access (%) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The percentage of households that have access to the internet. This can provide insights into the area's technological infrastructure and development.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Rent-burdened households (%) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The share of renter households with incomes less than \$35,000 that spend 30% or more of their income on rent. These households are more vulnerable to financial setbacks and economic shocks.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Mortgage burdened households (%) 2022**
    -   **Description:** Low-income households spending 30% or more of their income on mortgage payments. Higher percentages may show potential financial strain for low-income homeowners.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Median gross rent (\$) 2022**
    -   **Description:** The midpoint amount that households pay in total for their contract rent, utilities, and fuel costs. Higher median gross rent can indicate greater challenges with housing affordability for low-income households.
    -   **Source:** 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau
-   **Affordable housing shortage (units)**
    -   **Description:** The difference between the demand for rental units affordable to extremely low-income households (income \< 30% of area median income) and the supply available. A positive number indicates a shortage of affordable housing units.
    -   **Source:** Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) dataset, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
